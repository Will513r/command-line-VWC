        <ul>
            <li> Speed you can move through the system quickly and with minimal resources.</li>
            <li> You can use scripting to make task automated as well as working on multiple machines in the same network.</li>
         <li>You can accomplish complex tasks with simple commands.</li>
         </ul>
