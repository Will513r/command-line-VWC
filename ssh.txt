SSH is a way for the user to securely remote into their github repositories so they can work in the code bases
The reason they are more secure is they use keys instead of passwords
It can also be useful when automating git operations (per ChatGTP)
First I had to generate the ssh keys on my machine using the email associated with my github.
While I was doing this it asked me if I wanted a passphrase as I was typing it in I realized I couldn't see 
what I was typing for security purposes. I had to research why this was happening and make sure I didnt input the wrong passphrase 
But it wants you to re enter the same phrase to ensure I didnt make the mistake I thought I was going to make.
Next step was to assign the key to an agent for added security and not just having the key in an open file.
(which at first I thought was the key)
After that you add the key to github by going to the settings and hitting add public key and just copy and paste the key in there
You also name the key so can help separate work and personal or whatever reason you may have multiple keys.
Lastly you verify the connection which if successful You should receive a message indicating a successful authentication.
