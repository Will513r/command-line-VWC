The CLI and the GUI pronounced gooey are two ways that the user can interact with the machine;
 one the CLI or command line interface is through keyboard only and has a steep learning curve
  but allows for less system requirements and has more precise control of the machine. 
  Two the GUI or graphical user interface is what most users are used to and that is thought of
   the applications and desktop icons which is usually more intuitive and has a much lower learning
    curve. But requires more system requirements.
So while the CLI is much faster and precise it is extremely difficult to master and has a very 
steep learning curve. As for the GUI the learning curve is much lower but it requires more power
 from the machine and is not as precise or as fast. So depending on what your purpose of using the
  machine will decide which interface you will need to use as they do the same thing but 
  for different reasons.
