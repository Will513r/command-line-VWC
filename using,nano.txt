Used nano to add a note to my txt file.

vi is a text editor that has different modes for 
`navigation
`editing
`running commands. 
I navigated thru a text file with this command. 
I did not do much else as it became difficult to understand what was going on.

emacs did not work in my terminal but my understanding is it is similar 
to how the other commands work in this section with two modes normal and insert.
